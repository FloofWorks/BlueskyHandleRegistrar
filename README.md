# Bluesky Handle Registrar
---
### What is this?
This is a collection of NodeJS Applications that Allow you to host a web-form, which people can fill out to register a bluesky handle on your domain.


### How does it work?
When Bluesky Verifies any given handle, it uses one of two methods to verify.

#### DNS Record
In this example, we want to verify the handle "furo.lucario.social". Our Domain is "lucario.social" and our handle is "furo", 
so Bluesky Checks for a TXT Record at "_atproto.furo.lucario.social" which should return a DID value, that points to a users account. If the request is successful
and the DNS Record exists, your handle is verified! :D But this is not the Verification method we are interested in!

#### Text File
An alternative to the DNS Record check, is a simple web-request! Let's keep our example handle of "furo.lucairo.social", and say that the DNS Record Check failed, what does bluesky now?
It sends a API-Request to "https://furo.lucario.social/.well-known/atproto-did", and expects a given DID to be returned. At it's simplest, the code for this would look like this:
```js
app.get('/.well-known/atproto-did', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("did:plc:theDIDgoesHere");
}
```

But You want to let people register their own handles and use your domain for that! How could that work?
The answer? Databases!
