# Bluesky Handle Registrar
---
### What is this?
This is a collection of NodeJS Applications that Allow you to host a web-form, which people can fill out to register a bluesky handle on your domain.
This also allows users to customize where "https://handle.domain.com" redirects, either a Custom URL or Their Bluesky Profile.


### How does it work?
When Bluesky Verifies any given handle, it uses one of two methods to verify.

#### DNS Record
In this example, we want to verify the handle "furo.lucario.social". Our Domain is "lucario.social" and our handle is "furo", 
so Bluesky Checks for a TXT Record at "_atproto.furo.lucario.social" which should return a DID value, that points to a users account. If the request is successful
and the DNS Record exists, your handle is verified! :D But this is not the Verification method we are interested in!

#### Text File
An alternative to the DNS Record check, is a simple web-request! Let's keep our example handle of "furo.lucairo.social", and say that the DNS Record Check failed, what does bluesky now?
It sends a API-Request to "https://furo.lucario.social/.well-known/atproto-did", and expects a given DID to be returned. At it's simplest, the code for this would look like this:
```js
app.get('/.well-known/atproto-did', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("did:plc:theDIDgoesHere");
}
```

But You want to let people register their own handles and use your domain for that! How could that work?
The answer? Databases!


### Backend (scary)
Inside the backend, we have a couple of endpoints, but most importantly these:
- / (root)
```markdown
The Root Path is used to redirect people to the their handle redirection target URL, or simply their bluesky Profile
```
- /handle
```markdown
This serves the Form to Register a handle
```
- /redirect
```markdown
This serves a form to Setup where the https://handle.domain.com URL redirects.
```
- /debug
```markdown
This serves a Debug Page to View Registrants' data and modify it.
```
- /api/register
```markdown
API Endpoint To Register
```
- /.well-known/atproto-did
```markdown
Bluesky Endpoint that serves a given handle's DID value
```
- /api/public/registrants
```markdown
API Endpoint that serves all registrants that have been verified.
```
- /api/getDataByUser/:username
```markdown
API Endpoint that serves all users Handles that match the username.
```
- /api/getDataByDid/:did
```markdown
API Endpoint that serves all users that match the DID.
```
- /api/getDataByDomain/:domain
```markdown
API Endpoint that serves all users' data that match the given domain.
```
- /api/getDataByHandle/:handle
```markdown
API Endpoint that returns a user that matches the handle.
```


### Registering
When a user Registers a handle, they have to input their desired handle, an E-Mail, and their Bluesky Account DID. The server has a string array for "Pure" and "Reserved" Handles.

#### Pure Handles
A Pure handle is any handle where the handle reflects a popular object's name, or a dictionary word, such as "Lucario" or "Tree". 
These handles require manual Verification by you, something you can do via the /debug endpoint.

#### Reserved Handles
Do you have friends? Surely you'd like to reserve them some handles! To make sure nobody registers with a handle that should belong to your friend, 
the server refuses to let people register a reserved handle.

#### How does Verification Work?
Internally, every user has a State. 
```markdown
V = Verified
NV = Not Verified
V_F = Verified Pure Handle
VR = Verification Rejected
VR_F = Pure Handle Verification Rejected
PENDING = For Debug Purposes
```
When a user registers a Non-Pure handle, their handle's state is automatically set to "V".
When a user registers a Pure Handle, their handle's state is set to NV.

The server ONLY Responds to any endpoint requests with users that are either in the state "V" or "V_F".
To manually Verify a User, Open the /debug endpoint, find your target user, and Click the Pen Icon and Change their state to "V_F".
